# CodeFights
You will find here my solutions for the CodeFights exercices. 

Please try your best in solving a problem by yourself before 
checking the solution! After checking the solution, try to 
understand the algorithm I used and write another solution on
your own!

The purpose of this repository is NOT to provide an easy way 
to copy/paste a solution in codefights!

The code posted here are my personal solution for the exercices.
They may or may not be the most efficient/optimal way to solve
a given exercice. However, I am open to any suggestion that will
help me improve my code.

I will add new solutions as I solve them. So if you don't find 
a solution for an exercice you are looking for, it is either 
because I didn't solve it yet, or because I didn't have the time 
to post my solution.

Thank you and enjoy!
